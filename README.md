This is a program that checks all videos on trendings and gets it's categories and returns a pie chart of it.

## What have I learned with the project?
### Web driver
Using `selenium` package, I was able to perform web scrap with a Chrome web driver (you can find it on `tools` file)

## Setting up
In order to run, you will need some libraries
* Selenium
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Datetime

In your `cmd`, you can use `pip install` to get the packages
```
> pip install selenium pandas matplotlib seaborn datetime
```
Now you can run `scraper.py` and after about 8 minutes, you will have your chart saved on scraper's repository
